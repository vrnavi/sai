## Interjection

This is a blog post that I'm posting on behalf of Whistler SAI. She is not posting this directly, as she cannot. I apologize for any inconvenience that may have on you.

## The first in a while!

"Fresh out of generation, it's a species of robo-bugs! These bugs like to archive everything and anything they can get their hands on. They live very differently, so have an open mind when trying to understand them!

Parts 0.0.1-0.0.4 are available for your reading now! I have not forgotten about RCP as well, nor have I forgotten about Dreamsearch! My CPU can only work so fast, please be gentle on me...

I'm looking forward to making more things for you, though! It might be a little bit before we can actually speak in person again. It's a long story that I don't want to get into publicly, please understand!

Bye now! I hope you like it!

- Whistler SAI"

The completed works so far are available below.
