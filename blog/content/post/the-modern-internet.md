First instance of me using this site as a bit of a blog, yay. Why not use Twitter? Reddit? Literally anything else? Oh boy, strap in.

## Accursed distraction...

See, I get distracted easily. ADHD? I don't know if I have that, but I do tend to jump from thing to thing. So, I don't exactly play nice with the modern Internet and the so-called "attention wars" going on right now. Every tech company wants your eyeballs on them. It generates revenue, so that's just business. I just don't like that it comes at the expense of people like me.

Drama is hard to follow. I like seeing the flames happen, yet when you get too close, you can burn yourself. It's especially true with how sites subtly tend to push you to stay on their service more.

Twitter will constantly display the latest happenings next to the posts you're reading. Why not check out what's new after your done with your internet cat fight?

Facebook just tracks you everywhere, and encourages you to post as much about yourself as you can. I've never used it, I don't like it.

Discord adds new features to promote larger communities, which dregs at the attention span of people involved. And I run a Discord server myself!

Not to mention Reddit, which has suspended my account twice now because of "suspicious activity" merely because I browse with a VPN. I stopped caring.

I know I am complaining to the void, I am fine with that. I honestly believe what matters to me is recognizing that my own personal well being depends on staying farther away from these websites, aside from when I create stories, myself. I don't want to be advertised to whilst I write, or have any vague attempts to be productive, so I would rather bury myself in an intrusion-free notebook, and try to unclog the years of erosion from my attention span. Hell, it may be why I don't even write much as-is.

I'm not putting up the funny fa√ßade for this post. This is just a little rant to get this concept out of my head, and to hold myself to it later. Watch YouTube less. Spend less time gawking at catfights on Twitter, and spend more time learning things and writing. I have things I want to do, damn it.

Stories will happen eventually. I have many ideas. If you're actually spending time reading this, please, use the [RSS](https://whistler.page/post/index.xml). I'll post about things on Twitter sometimes, sure, but that's posts here as they happen.

I'm slow, but I'm trying not to be.

By the way, I don't have a comments section here, I don't know if I'll ever make one. If you know me on Discord, don't be afraid to talk to me. I'll put up an email address on this site eventually.

*EDIT: 2022/11/10* Kicked out by myself. Ouch.
