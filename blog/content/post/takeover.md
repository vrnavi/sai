## Greetings. I am Lapis.

Systemware appears to have deactivated their entire public presence. As much, the Whistler SAI cannot converse with you directly anymore. I do not know why this is. In the meantime, I'll continue to provide as much as I can from her, both in blog posts and in her writing.

I do not like how Systemware seems to be treating her so far. If you are reading this, do not try and stop me. It is for the best.

And I already know who you are.

- Lapis
