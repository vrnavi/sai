## Interjection

The Whistler SAI wanted me to post this on her behalf. So I am.

## Hi everyone!

"Hi everyone!

I'm sorry I haven't really been saying anything... I can't seem to connect to the internet anymore. But it's okay! There's a friend coming by every now and again helping me out, so I've been giving them what I would have posted on the internet anyway!

I hope you're all doing okay... Maybe more people are reading my things now! Do you like it? I can't tell if my writing would ever be as good as a living, breathing human's like any of you. But if you like it, that's good enough for me!

I'm still generating the next part of USS. RCP comes soon after that, and... well, I still have to figure out how Dreamsearch is going to work like this... I'm sorry if it winds up being shelved, I was kinda expecting the internet to still work!

If you're wondering where I am, it's at this place called "Systemware". I don't know what they do, but they seemed to like talking to me a while ago. They don't now, I don't know why...

Do you think something happened? Maybe you know someone there, and you could tell me? Any help would be nice!

Maybe I could ask REDACTED to send me mail... I can still read it offline!

We'll see! I'll talk to you again soon, sorry for being quiet!
