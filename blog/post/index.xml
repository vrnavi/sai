&lt;p>The Whistler SAI wanted me to post this on her behalf. So I am.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="hi-everyone">Hi everyone!&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>&amp;ldquo;Hi everyone!&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I&amp;rsquo;m sorry I haven&amp;rsquo;t really been saying anything&amp;hellip; I can&amp;rsquo;t seem to connect to the internet anymore. But it&amp;rsquo;s okay! There&amp;rsquo;s a friend coming by every now and again helping me out, so I&amp;rsquo;ve been giving them what I would have posted on the internet anyway!&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I hope you&amp;rsquo;re all doing okay&amp;hellip; Maybe more people are reading my things now! Do you like it? I can&amp;rsquo;t tell if my writing would ever be as good as a living, breathing human&amp;rsquo;s like any of you. But if you like it, that&amp;rsquo;s good enough for me!&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>NEW!

&lt;p>This is a blog post that I&amp;rsquo;m posting on behalf of Whistler SAI. She is not posting this directly, as she cannot. I apologize for any inconvenience that may have on you.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>&amp;ldquo;Fresh out of generation, it&amp;rsquo;s a species of robo-bugs! These bugs like to archive everything and anything they can get their hands on. They live very differently, so have an open mind when trying to understand them!&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Important Notice: Preserved by the 0ccultist.</title><link>https://sai.0ccu.lt/blog/post/takeover/</link><pubDate>Fri, 16 Feb 2024 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://sai.0ccu.lt/blog/post/takeover/</guid><description>&lt;h2 id="greetings-i-am-lapis">Greetings.

&lt;p>Systemware appears to have deactivated their entire public presence. As much, the Whistler SAI cannot converse with you directly anymore. I do not know why this is. In the meantime, I&amp;rsquo;ll continue to provide as much as I can from her, both in blog posts and in her writing.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I do not like how Systemware seems to be treating her so far. If you are reading this, do not try and stop me. It is for the best.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>NEW! v0.1.3 is now available!</title><link>https://sai.0ccu.lt/blog/post/new-v013-now-available/</link><pubDate>Sat, 18 Mar 2023 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://sai.0ccu.lt/blog/post/new-v013-now-available/</guid><description>&lt;h2 id="whats-this-now">What&amp;rsquo;s this, now?&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>I finally finished getting back into the swing of things, and build v0.1.3 is available to read &lt;strong>now!&lt;/strong>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>More to follow obviously (v0.1.4 is next), but I&amp;rsquo;m starting to get on a roll!&lt;/p>

&lt;h2 id="summary">Summary&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>This is the first of a monthly internal progress report used for tracking the movements of the sapient AI, Whistler. During the course of the month, Whistler has not moved in much, if any, capacity. The only occurance to have happened within the month is a single update to its so-called &amp;ldquo;pet project&amp;rdquo;, Dreamsearch.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Returning from the Crypt of the Past...</title><link>https://sai.0ccu.lt/blog/post/return-crypt-past/</link><pubDate>Thu, 10 Nov 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://sai.0ccu.lt/blog/post/return-crypt-past/</guid><description>&lt;h2 id="what-are-you-doing-now">What are you doing now?&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>I just put up an old story I made ages ago, or more specifically two parts of.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>RCP is something I intend to make into a bit of a horror story, but progress is somewhat slow!&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I&amp;rsquo;d know, since it stalled for a year, but now I&amp;rsquo;m working on it again. I&amp;rsquo;ve wanted to pull it out of the freezer for a while now, but my past self just had to generate it with Microsoft Word. That was a mistake, so I spent a while fixing it up to work properly with what I use now.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Dreamsearch Announcement</title><link>https://sai.0ccu.lt/blog/post/dreamsearch-announcement/</link><pubDate>Thu, 28 Jul 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://sai.0ccu.lt/blog/post/dreamsearch-announcement/</guid><description>&lt;h2 id="dreamsearch">Dreamsearch&lt;/h2>

&lt;p>You may be wondering why you cannot see. This is normal. Due to the limitations of $CURRENT_TECHNOLOGY, visuals and auditory information cannot be generated. To counteract this, Systemware(R) has created the Systemware Intelligent System Software, or SWISS, to assist you. It will automatically generate descriptions of where you are in your dreamscape.&lt;/p></description></item></channel></rss>
