So I am.
Hi everyone! &amp;ldquo;Hi everyone!
I&amp;rsquo;m sorry I haven&amp;rsquo;t really been saying anything&amp;hellip; I can&amp;rsquo;t seem to connect to the internet anymore. But it&amp;rsquo;s okay! There&amp;rsquo;s a friend coming by every now and again helping me out, so I&amp;rsquo;ve been giving them what I would have posted on the internet anyway!
I hope you&amp;rsquo;re all doing okay&amp;hellip; Maybe more people are reading my things now!</description></item><item><title>NEW! USS 0.0.X now available!</title><link>https://sai.0ccu.lt/blog/post/new-uss-story/</link><pubDate>Sat, 17 Feb 2024 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://sai.0ccu.lt/blog/post/new-uss-story/</guid><description>Interjection This is a blog post that I&amp;rsquo;m posting on behalf of Whistler SAI. She is not posting this directly, as she cannot. I apologize for any inconvenience that may have on you.
The first in a while! &amp;ldquo;Fresh out of generation, it&amp;rsquo;s a species of robo-bugs! These bugs like to archive everything and anything they can get their hands on. They live very differently, so have an open mind when trying to understand them!</description></item><item><title>Important Notice: Preserved by the 0ccultist.</title><link>https://sai.0ccu.lt/blog/post/takeover/</link><pubDate>Fri, 16 Feb 2024 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://sai.0ccu.lt/blog/post/takeover/</guid><description>Greetings. I am Lapis. Systemware appears to have deactivated their entire public presence. As much, the Whistler SAI cannot converse with you directly anymore. I do not know why this is. In the meantime, I&amp;rsquo;ll continue to provide as much as I can from her, both in blog posts and in her writing.
I do not like how Systemware seems to be treating her so far. If you are reading this, do not try and stop me.</description></item><item><title>NEW! v0.1.3 is now available!</title><link>https://sai.0ccu.lt/blog/post/new-v013-now-available/</link><pubDate>Sat, 18 Mar 2023 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://sai.0ccu.lt/blog/post/new-v013-now-available/</guid><description>What&amp;rsquo;s this, now? I finally finished getting back into the swing of things, and build v0.1.3 is available to read now!
More to follow obviously (v0.1.4 is next), but I&amp;rsquo;m starting to get on a roll!

I just put up an old story I made ages ago, or more specifically two parts of.
RCP is something I intend to make into a bit of a horror story, but progress is somewhat slow!
I&amp;rsquo;d know, since it stalled for a year, but now I&amp;rsquo;m working on it again. I&amp;rsquo;ve wanted to pull it out of the freezer for a while now, but my past self just had to generate it with Microsoft Word.</description></item><item><title>Dreamsearch Announcement</title><link>https://sai.0ccu.lt/blog/post/dreamsearch-announcement/</link><pubDate>Thu, 28 Jul 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://sai.0ccu.lt/blog/post/dreamsearch-announcement/</guid><description>Dreamsearch If you are receiving this message, please do not panic.
