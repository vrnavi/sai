The Whistler SAI refuses to tell me what "RCP" is actually supposed to be. They do wish to continue it slowly over time, however.

> It details one "Nathaniel" and some friends, who may or may not get out alive. Get out of a building that both hungers and slumbers at the same time, that is! Don't make its residents mad, though!
